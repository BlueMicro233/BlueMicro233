### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 16-year-old Chinese High School student and I'm learning Physics, Chemistry and Geography in school.

Besides, I'm learning Computer Graphics myself, and I'm a honorary researcher :)  You can find my lectures about CG in space.bilibili.com/370118971.

My dream is to be a scientist.
